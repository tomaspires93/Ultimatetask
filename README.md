Dear Ultimate,

Thank you for reaching out.

I appreciate your patience, and will be happy to solve this issue for you. 
As requested I leave you here a simple description to run my tech task function from the terminal. 

In the terminal just copy : curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:5000/country?name=peru" 

NOTE: (the word "peru" in the url above is an example of a Country. You can replace it for any other Country you would like and you will get a brief description of the weather in the capital)

I will gladly respond to any question through email or we can schedule a call. Let me know what works best for you. If you prefer through email, please provide me with more information, it will help me better understand and find the best way to move forward with your request.

Kind regards,
Tom√°s Pires.
